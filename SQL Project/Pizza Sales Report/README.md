# Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to analyze pizza sales data using SQL to understand business performance and customer buying habits. This analysis aims to calculate key financial metrics like total revenue and average order value while also tracking the volume of pizzas sold and total order counts. Furthermore, the project identifies sales trends over days and months, discovers which pizza categories and sizes are the most popular, and highlights the top and bottom performing pizzas based on revenue, quantity, and total orders to help the business make better decisions.

# Recommendation
To further increase our total revenue, the company should focus on maximizing the high traffic during Fridays and Saturdays by ensuring optimal staffing and inventory readiness. We should also leverage the success of The Thai Chicken Pizza, while re-evaluating or rebranding The Brie Carre Pizza, which has the lowest sales. To improve our average order value, we can introduce bundled deals that encourage customers to exceed the current average of 2.32 pizzas per order. Additionally, since July and January show the highest seasonal demand, launching targeted marketing campaigns during these months will help maintain our growth momentum across all 21,350 unique orders.
